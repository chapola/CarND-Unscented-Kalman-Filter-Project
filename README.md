# Unscented Kalman Filter Project Starter Code
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

In this project utilize an Unscented Kalman Filter to estimate the state of a moving object of interest with noisy lidar and radar measurements. Passing the project requires obtaining RMSE values that are lower that the tolerance outlined in the project rubric. 

This project involves the Term 2 Simulator which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases)

This repository includes two files that can be used to set up and intall [uWebSocketIO](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets) for either Linux or Mac systems. For windows you can use either Docker, VMware, or even [Windows 10 Bash on Ubuntu](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/) to install uWebSocketIO. Please see [this concept in the classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/16cf4a78-4fc7-49e1-8621-3450ca938b77) for the required version and installation scripts.

Once the install for uWebSocketIO is complete, the main program can be built and ran by doing the following from the project top directory.

1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make
5. ./UnscentedKF

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

Note that the programs that need to be written to accomplish the project are src/ukf.cpp, src/ukf.h, tools.cpp, and tools.h

The program main.cpp has already been filled out, but feel free to modify it.

Here is the main protcol that main.cpp uses for uWebSocketIO in communicating with the simulator.


INPUT: values provided by the simulator to the c++ program

["sensor_measurement"] => the measurment that the simulator observed (either lidar or radar)


OUTPUT: values provided by the c++ program to the simulator

["estimate_x"] <= kalman filter estimated position x
["estimate_y"] <= kalman filter estimated position y
["rmse_x"]
["rmse_y"]
["rmse_vx"]
["rmse_vy"]

## Other Important Dependencies
* cmake >= 3.5
  * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./UnscentedKF` Previous versions use i/o from text files.  The current state uses i/o
from the simulator.

## Initialization paramaters


This project included the option to tune various initialization parameters to improve the final calculated RMSE (root mean squared error). In the ukf.cpp file, I noted which portions I tuned, which included std_a, std_yawd, the initialized x_ (separately for Radar and Lidar) and P_ (also separate for each sensor type).

std_a_: process noise standard deviation longitudinal acceleration in m/s^2. I settled on a value of 1 here, as for a bike (which is what we are detecting in this project) I would not expect very high acceleration.
std_yawd_: process noise standard deviation yaw acceleration in rad/s^2. A big would have to swerve pretty heavily for a big acceleration in yaw, so I settled for .5 radians here.
Radar
x_: Most of this is just an equation for the state space based off the first radar measurement. The middle value, for 'v', can be tuned. I set this to a value of 4 m/s as a quick Google search led me to an average bike speed of 15.5 km/h, which is just over 4 m/s
P_: The diagonal of the matrix are the variances for each value within the x_ state space (px, py, v, yaw, yawd). Radar feeds in rho, phi and rhodot. We are given the standard deviation of each of these, and the square of the standard deviation is the variance. Although this is not the exact right value (given its in a different state space), I used the square of the given standard deviations to calculate reasonable values for P_ (other than for the middle value of 'v' which I just set to 1.
Lidar
x_: The first two values are filled by the 'px' and 'py' lidar measurements. I chose 4 m/s for 'v' in the same way as for radar. I chose yaw of .5 as a reasonable estimate of a beginning turn, with yawd as 0 given no expected big swerves at the start.
P_: We are given the standard deviations for px and py from the lidar measurements, so I squared these to feed in the respective variances to the matrix. I just used 1 for the other variances along the diagonal as a reasonable beginning value.

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) as much as possible.

## Generating Additional Data

This is optional!

If you'd like to generate your own radar and lidar data, see the
[utilities repo](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Mercedes-SF-Utilities) for
Matlab scripts that can generate additional data.
